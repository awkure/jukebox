Mostly to do with name generation:
* Allow generating names more flexibly, e.g., attach a prefix to a
  name, put the disambiguating number in a particular place.
  This will make GuessModel nicer and allow us to remove the
  clausifier monad.
* Make the disambiguator understand scope a bit better.
* Make the clausifier return a Problem [Clause] instead of
  ([Clause], [[Clause]])?
  (Don't generate clause names, instead associate each input formula
  with a list of output clauses.)

* Guess-model: skolemise problem first
* Type inference
* Support for non-formula inputs, e.g. domain size restrictions
  (produced by type inference) or interpreted domains?

* Clean up generic stuff.

* Make output TPTP-compliant and catch exceptions+print with "internal
  error" message.

* Work out how to do $distinct, $answer (wrt types). Possibilities:
    * polymorphism
    * give each instance a different name, don't use suffix in
      uniquifier for them
    * give each instance a different name, mark somehow as special
      (give Function type a semantics field?)
    * give each instance a different name, maintain a list of
      "special" names
  Maybe rule out polymorphism for now---in full generality,
  things like a -> b make our life hard. (type variable on right
  that's not on left.) Add "semantics" field?? Bit icky...

* Form.isFof: don't look for $i, check for unitypedness.
  Maybe remove $i from stdNames altogether?

* Split Name class into Named and Described classes
  so that 1) String/ByteString can be member of Described but not Named,
  2) we can implement addPrefix and addSuffix (Described a => String -> a -> a)

* Support TFF1 (polymorphism)? Something like
  Function = (Name ::: FunType) ::: [Type]
  so that we retain f :@: ts for application.

* Make GuessModel work with conjecture and existentials.

* Make E interface preserve names and print out satisfiability status.
* Add Equinox interface (including model finding)

* Allow parsing of CNF directly?

* Put GuessModel refinement loop in Haskell code

* Make main loop prettier.

* Clean up toolbox mess.

* Remove as many exclamation marks as possible

* Sort out genericity stuff

* Add helper functions for running NameM stuff.

* Allow some names to have fixed string interpretations (like $answer, $i).

* Allow some terms to have fixed types?? (like distinct objects etc.)
  These should be preserved by type inference.
  Maybe a fancier type structure would help here.

* Similarly, we have certain clauses that shouldn't be printed out.
  e.g. $distinct for distinct objects,
  declaring the type $i,
  declaring functions at type $i.
  Is there a uniform way to deal with this?

* Make = a predicate? Would need to have some way of
  pattern-matching on it.
