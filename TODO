* Change formula representation:
    - Bool/Int/Real/Nat as constructors for Type
    - Builtins as constructors for Function
    - Get rid of ::: - use Typed and Named instance for e.g. Function instead

    Possible problem: what happens to functions like $plus when we translate
    to FOF? Can we always do type substitution e.g. turning $rat to $i?
    Maybe all builtins have to be allowed at all types.

* Add $distinct, $answer.
* Allow some terms to have fixed types (like distinct objects etc.)
  These should be preserved by type inference.

* Put together CNFRefutations properly when proving multiple conjectures.
